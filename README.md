## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was able to learn more about "conditional" classes in CSS, e.g:

```css
.input-control.error input;
```

instead of

```css
.input-control .error input;
```

Also, how to add form validation like this using functions. It was very insightful!

### Continued development

I would like to keep focusing on more JavaScript and functions.

### Useful resources
